## Meeting 01.11.2024
Important things is not to do very hard things but more to be really acurate in what we analyse and make clear description, visual one too, see [oldProject](https://hadriensevel.github.io/vivalavada/#fnref:3)

### Ideas : 
- Divide proposal
  - Basic analysis
  - IPA analysis
    - why grows ?
    - Correlation between positive comment and growing
  - Trend analysis
    - Group beers and analysis grows
    - percentages over years 
  - Recommandation system
    - k means
    - Matrix betwenn raters and beers  
  - Link user emotion to beer review
    - [Big fives](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-big-five-personality-dimensions-2795422)
  - Different description for same beer
    - Group beers and try to see if comments vary between users
  
- Set up website for final project

### Dispatch
- Arnault -> Basic analysis + IPA analysis
- Valentin + Guillen + Dani -> link user emotion + Different description for same beer
- Anas -> TODO
- Still need to do recommandation system but we agree to do that later


## Project Description

"a beer recommender. The goal is to recommend a new beer to the raters. We will try to cluster the beers and/or the personas to be able to create recommendations for the raters. We will try to see which features (location/brewery.size/beer-features,...) influence the ratings in order to cluster people/beers effectively."
