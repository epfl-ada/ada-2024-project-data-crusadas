## Meeting 29.11.2024

### Refined the proposal, need an overall goal

We create clusters of beer then 
Make a recommander that given a user assign them a cluster they will like
We don't ask the user for the data, we extract them from the reviews
Some cluster analysis is good to have

### Discuss who does what

Anas has done work on clustering, the work on IPA should be also done on those clusters

Val will take the refined proposal the office hours
Anas will do the recommander
Val, Dani, Arnault, Guillen work on cluster analysis
Anas will share the clusters

#### Cluster assignment
- (2 is IPA so already done)
- Val 0, 1
- Dani 3,4
- Arnault 5,6
- guillen 7,8

One notebook per cluster

### Web
No Assignee yet : Start the structure of the web 




## Meeting 14.11.2024
For now we don't use the merging to the preprocessing, but we show it

### pipeline : 
- Week 1: Rise of IPA, Merging datasets
- Week 2: Recommender system, NLP, 
- Week 3: Merging results, filtering informations, conclusion on the results
- Week 4: Clean git, work on deliverable, work on website

Need to clean the repo!

### TODO for m2
- Preprocessing from Dani
- Filter from Guillen
- Make final notebook (Arnault)
- Readme (Valentin)
- Clean repo (Valentin)

## Meeting 01.11.2024
Important things is not to do very hard things but more to be really acurate in what we analyse and make clear description, visual one too, see [oldProject](https://hadriensevel.github.io/vivalavada/#fnref:3)

### Ideas : 
- Divide proposal
  - Basic analysis
  - IPA analysis
    - why grows ?
    - Correlation between positive comment and growing
  - Trend analysis
    - Group beers and analysis grows
    - percentages over years 
  - Recommandation system
    - k means
    - Matrix betwenn raters and beers  
  - Link user emotion to beer review
    - [Big fives](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-big-five-personality-dimensions-2795422)
  - Different description for same beer
    - Group beers and try to see if comments vary between users
  
- Set up website for final project

### Dispatch
- Arnault -> Basic analysis + IPA analysis
- Valentin + Guillen + Dani -> link user emotion + Different description for same beer
- Anas -> TODO
- Still need to do recommandation system but we agree to do that later


## Project Description

"a beer recommender. The goal is to recommend a new beer to the raters. We will try to cluster the beers and/or the personas to be able to create recommendations for the raters. We will try to see which features (location/brewery.size/beer-features,...) influence the ratings in order to cluster people/beers effectively."
