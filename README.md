## Meeting 14.11.2024
For now we don't use the merging to the preprocessing, but we show it

### pipeline : 
Week 1: Rise of IPA, Merging datasets
Week 2: Recommender system, NLP, 
Week 3: Merging results, filtering informations, conclusion on the results
Week 4: Clean git, work on deliverable, work on website

Need to clean the repo!

### TODO for m2
- Preprocessing from Dani
- Filter from Guillen
- Make final notebook (Arnault)
- Readme (Valentin)
- Clean repo (Valentin)

# From Hops to Glass
## A Comprehensive Analysis of Beer Characteristics

### Abstract
This study explores various analytical methods to understand trends, preferences, and perceptions in the beer industry, focusing on the popular IPA category. We investigate the factors driving IPA growth, including correlations between positive reviews and market expansion. Through trend analysis, beers are grouped by type, with growth patterns and yearly changes calculated as percentages. A recommendation system employing K-means clustering and a matrix of raters-to-beers is developed to suggest beers based on user preferences. Additionally, we analyze the link between user emotions and beer reviews by mapping sentiment to the Big Five personality traits. Finally, we explore variation in descriptions of the same beer to determine if different users experience and describe beers uniquely. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into consumer behavior and potential tools for personalized beer recommendations.

### Research questions
- What makes a trend grow
- What are the characteristic of a given beer based on commentary

### Proposed additional datasets
 There are no direct additional datasets.

### Methods
- LDA
- Word Clouds
- Statistical Analysis
- 

### Proposed timeline
Week 1 : 
Week 2 : 
Week 3 : 
Week 4 : 
Week 5 : 

### Organization within the team
#### Dispatch 
- Arnault -> Basic analysis + IPA analysis
- Valentin + Guillen + Dani -> link user emotion + Different description for same beer
- Anas -> Merging datasets





## Meeting 01.11.2024
Important things is not to do very hard things but more to be really acurate in what we analyse and make clear description, visual one too, see [oldProject](https://hadriensevel.github.io/vivalavada/#fnref:3)

### Ideas : 
- Divide proposal
  - Basic analysis
  - IPA analysis
    - why grows ?
    - Correlation between positive comment and growing
  - Trend analysis
    - Group beers and analysis grows
    - percentages over years 
  - Recommandation system
    - k means
    - Matrix betwenn raters and beers  
  - Link user emotion to beer review
    - [Big fives](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-big-five-personality-dimensions-2795422)
  - Different description for same beer
    - Group beers and try to see if comments vary between users
  
- Set up website for final project

### Dispatch
- Arnault -> Basic analysis + IPA analysis
- Valentin + Guillen + Dani -> link user emotion + Different description for same beer
- Anas -> TODO
- Still need to do recommandation system but we agree to do that later


## Project Description

"a beer recommender. The goal is to recommend a new beer to the raters. We will try to cluster the beers and/or the personas to be able to create recommendations for the raters. We will try to see which features (location/brewery.size/beer-features,...) influence the ratings in order to cluster people/beers effectively."
