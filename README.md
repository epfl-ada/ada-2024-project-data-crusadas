## Project Description

"a beer recommender. The goal is to recommend a new beer to the raters. We will try to cluster the beers and/or the personas to be able to create recommendations for the raters. We will try to see which features (location/brewery.size/beer-features,...) influence the ratings in order to cluster people/beers effectively."
